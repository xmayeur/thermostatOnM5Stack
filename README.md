Author:     X. Mayeur
Version:    v1.0

Hardware:   M5Stack Core2
            DHT22 on pin 33
            mini relay module on pin 32

Function:

- This program read the DTH22 temperature and regulate it using a reference temperature
- The regulator is a simple hysteresis comparator switching a relay on and off if the actual temperature
differs from more than 1Â°C with respect to the reference temperature
- The reference temperature is adjusted according to a weekly schedule having one or more periods to
switch between the day and night temperature references. A period has a start and end hour (format 'HHMM')
for which the reference temperature will be day temperature reference
- Day and night temperature references are editable via the screen using the displayed buttons
- Week schedule is not editable from UI but can be set by publishing it via mqtt
on the topic thermostat/weekSchedule
- The thermostat can be switched to the following modes:
    - OFF: relay stays open forever - thermostat is OFF
    - ON: relays stays closed for the next 5 minutes then switch to AUTO
    - AUTO: the temperature is regulated according to week schedule
    - DAY: the temperature is regulated to the day reference temperature until the next day
    - NIGHT: the temperature is regulated to the night reference temperature until the next day
- A touch on the middle of the display toggle the screen brightness between 15% and 100%.
  the screen is always dimmed to 15% after 30 sec.
